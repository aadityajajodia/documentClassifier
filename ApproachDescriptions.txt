First Approach
86.89 accuracy
max len of sentence was 80. I think its was because of this len because of which training was taking so long.


Second Approach
As additonal preprocessing step removing words with length 3 or less.
Fixing max len of sentence to 25.

Third Approach
As additional preprcoessing step removing words with length 3 or less.
Fixing max len of sentence to 25.
Using bidirectional LSTM
